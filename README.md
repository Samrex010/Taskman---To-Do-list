# Task Manager - chrome extension
I made this little to-do list/Task manager chrome extension using javascript.
it's a simple application, but it has some issues that i wasn't able to solve since i didn't have enough time.
i used localStorage to store and retrieve data, instead of database.

Feautues: Add Tasks, Remove tasks, Mark tasks as finished.

How to install:
1. Download and extract folder
2. open chrome, go to 'More tools' and click 'Extensions'.
3. Click on 'Load unpacked' from above, Select the folder directory and click 'Select folder'.
4. Extension will be loaded to the browser, Now you can start using it.

Every task is saved to localStorage
